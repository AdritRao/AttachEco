# AttachEco
Code for AttachEco project for the NASA Space Apps Challenge.

Summary:
AttachEco is a small device that sends environmental data to a mobile app. AttachEco incorporates gas, temperature and humidity sensors and can be connected to the back of any mobile device. The AttachEco app collects sensor data from the device and displays it on a map view. As many users start using AttachEco, the map view will be populated with crowdsourced data which will inform future generations on the gas, temperature and humidity trends. The AttachEco app also has integrated Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning organism detection algorithms that can be used with the mobile phone camera by children to learn about biodiversity. It also features NASA website data for educational purposes.
